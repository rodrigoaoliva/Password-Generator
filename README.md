# Password-Generator

## Description

This password generator is a simple tool to generate password based on your criteria. 

I was motivated to work on this project because it gave me the opportunity to expand my Javascript
skills by using variables, functions, loops, conditional logic, randomization and event handling.

## Usage

1. Visit the website https://rodrigoaoliva.github.io/Password-Generator/.
2. Click on the 'Generate Password' button. 
3. Set the length of your password by entering a number between 8 and 128 characters.
4. Choose if you'd like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in your password.
5. Your generated password will appear in the 'Your secure password' field.
